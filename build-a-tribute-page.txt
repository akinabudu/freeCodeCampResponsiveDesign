      <p>Dr. Norman Borlaug was a Nobel Peace Prize-winning agronomist who is credited with saving millions of lives through his work on developing high-yield wheat varieties.</p>
      <p>Borlaug was born in 1914 in Cresco, Iowa. He studied plant pathology at the University of Minnesota and Iowa State University. After graduating, he worked for the Rockefeller Foundation in Mexico, where he developed high-yield wheat varieties that could be grown in semi-arid conditions.</p>
      <p>Borlaug's work in Mexico had a major impact on the global food supply. The high-yield wheat varieties he developed helped to increase wheat production in developing countries, which led to a decline in hunger and malnutrition.</p>
      <p>Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his work on improving global food security. He died in 2009 at the age of 95.</p>
